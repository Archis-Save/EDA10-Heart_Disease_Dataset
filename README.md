Men have more heart disease than women. Risk goes up with age, especially after 50. Chest pain type is a strong sign. Cholesterol, max heart rate, and exercise angina matter a lot. Heatmap shows which features help in prediction. Blood pressure is also linked to risk. People with higher fasting blood sugar face more risk. Exercise test results can indicate heart problems. Some healthy people also show signs, so prediction is not 100% certain. Machine learning models can help doctors detect risk early.
